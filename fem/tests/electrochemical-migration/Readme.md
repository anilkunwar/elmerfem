# This tutorial solves Advection-Diffusion equation with Nernst-Planck Electromigration term.
# Transport of Sn and Zn in water are discussed in these examples. 
# For minimal test case, dirichlet BCs of potential are applied in this tutorial.
# The literature for these examples can be read at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026271418300441, which has several modifications than these minimalistic examples.
